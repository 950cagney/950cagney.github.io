Dear Cris: 

Just three months ago, God called you to be at his side.

It was sad for us to see you go, but at the same time I think that you have won your battle of life and are now being born again in Heaven. You always asked me to pray for you. I'm glad that today I could accomplish one of your wishes. 

Today, alongside your friends and son Steven, we prayed together in church at a [Holy Mass in your honor](/memorial/mass-april-26). I know that you are happy with this.

Sometimes when I feel tired, I stop myself, close my eyes and think of you. I see you continuing your journey in Heaven taking care of us. Since you departed many changes have occurred on the Earth; one of them is that our motherland has had the priviledge of giving to the world the succesor of Peter as a leader of our church. This makes my heart full of joy. I know how happy you would feel with our Pope Francis the 1st!

Sometimes I ask myself, did you request it to God for us--the first Argentine Pope!? I laugh thinking that you never stop being you. You always went to fulfill your dreams.

I love you Cris and I hope you're happy now that you are reunited in Heaven with all the souls that had departed before you.

With all my love for you,
Ana
