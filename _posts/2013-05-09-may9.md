Next week, Cristina would have attained the grand milestone of 70 years of living life to the fullest. The family would love to have friends join us to celebrate the memory and the spirit of Cristina at what would have been her 70th birthday.

**Thursday, May 9th, 2013** starting 7:00pm at Nick's Pizza on 2300 Harbor Blvd in Costa Mesa, CA 92626.

Cristina was looking forward to that round number so much that she talked about it often--many times jokingly telling the family to not worry about her chemotherapy treatments because she had already "signed a contract" with the guy upstairs to stick around until at least 70, so not to worry.

Nick's Pizza was a favorite spot for Cristina, having lunch there with her son Steven practically every week (and [sometimes for dinner](/memorial/march2012)). It was also the location for her [surprise 65th birthday](/memorial/bday2008) celebrated just five years ago surrounded by friends.

She became such a regular customer that Cristina had her "reserved" table and when they saw her pulling up in her green Toyota, they already had her drink waiting for her at the table: **water, no ice, with plenty of lemons.**

Her complicated lunch order was also no trouble at all for the kitchen and waiters, who loved to talk to her: **two meatballs Ã  la carte, sauce on the side, and garlic bread extra toasted without garlic nor butter.** They treated Cristina like family at Nick's.

Please RSVP by telephone. We hope to see you there! Bring only your smiling faces, memorable anecdotes, and funny memories. **This is not a funeral, this is a celebration!**
