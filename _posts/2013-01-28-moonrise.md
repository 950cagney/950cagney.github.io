Just two days after Cristina left this world, the people of Mount Victoria Lookout in Wellington, New Zealand were treated to one of the most grand spectacles in decades: a very close orbit and a very awe-inspiring "moonrise".

The photographer, Mark Gee, had been waiting for just the perfect night with the clearest conditions to record this impressive sight. His camera is actually over two kilometers away from the people seen in the video. He had tried many times before, but this night -- January 28th, 2013 -- everything was perfect.

It is worthwhile to take a four-minute break out of your busy day, turn off the lights in the room, and watch this video in FULL SCREEN glory and just reflect on what Cristina must be thinking right now. Enjoy!
