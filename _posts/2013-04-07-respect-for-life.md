Cristina with her downy hair out an inch and crocheted pooch cuddled in her lap, Giorgio, closest recipient of all her love, would pause "Judge Judy" and direct me to the family portrait, telling me of her outstanding son, Steven, and sweet daughter Adri. She couldn't stop talking of how proud she was of her children and Teresa's children.

But mostly, I think of Cristina's awe and respect for life, perhaps founded in her nursing career, her determination to be right in the middle of the living as long as possible, refusing to stop despite her illness, going out in her bandana and blanket to enjoy the passing crowd at Fashion Island or the 99Â¢ store.

Every cent, every second counted.

Thank you, Cristina!
