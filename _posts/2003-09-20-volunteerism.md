Cristina Andrés, a University Medical Center volunteer for 2 years, has become an important member of the team at the hospital. She has generously volunteered her time and has become involved in many important organizations affiliated with UMC. For example, she is a member of UMC Auxiliary whose mission is to provide discretionary funds to UMC for the purchase of needed medical equipment. She assists that organization in raising money for the hospital's needs.

More importantly, she has been a volunteer at UMC for two years as an Interpreter. She speaks three languages: Spanish, Italian, and Portugese. Someone with Mrs. Andrés' competence and skill in interpreting and language proficiency would normally charge $40-$60 dollars an hour for her services. However, Cristina volunteers her time six hours a day, interpreting for patients, families, and visitors. She has become well known to the staff because of her professionalism and willingness to educate staff on cultural issues and intercultural communication.

UMC has a multilingual, multicultural base. Cristina generously offers her time to help limited of non-English speaking individuals find their way around the hospital. In addition, she goes above and beyond the call of duty by donating her time on evenings and weekends to interpret for UMC's Family to Family Connection where she teaches various classes in Spanish such as breast feeding, childcare, etc. She also teaches babysitting classes in Spanish to local teenagers enrolled in UMC's Safe Sitter classes.

One of the most notable examples of Cristina's excellence in volunteerism took place recently when she was called upon to interpret in a very emotional and difficult situation. She was called to the Pediatric Emergency Room to convey test results to the parents of a three-year-old child who was the victim of a traumatic accident. The test results showed negative blood flow to the brain, i.e., brain death, and life support was to be removed from the child. The family was Hispanic and did not speak English. 

When Cristina arrived she educated the physician on the importance of communicating with the entire family unit. She choreographed the setting in a quiet room to include the parents, the priest, and extended family members. The physician asked Cristina to sit at the head of the table to facilitate interpretation. She informed her that in Hispanic culture it is important for the physician, as an authority figure, to sit at the head of the table.

Cristina sat to the doctor's right and if any concepts or meanings required more time to explain, Cristina would ask permission to elaborate. Cristina interpreted the information regarding the child's condition and the test results with sensitivity and compassion. Even in such tragic circumstances, the family was left with a positive impression of UMC, its doctors, professionals and the volunteer program.

Cristina provides interpretation services every day with the same poise and professionalism regardless of the circumstances. Her willingness to perform this role cheerfully and unstintingly makes her a unique and outstanding individual who has gained immense respect from the staff and administration of UMC. She does an excellent job in fulfilling UMC's Mission and Vision to provide a healthcare system that all of society will choose.

Cristina came to UMC as a volunteer with over 30 years of experience at a California acute care hospital as an RN. The administrative staff at UMC is very proud of Mrs. Andrés and feels she is more than worthy of the NAHHS Award for Excellence in Volunteerism.
