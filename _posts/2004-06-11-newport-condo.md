In 2004, Steven purchased a condo in Newport Beach right next to Hoag Hospital so that Cristina could continue chemotherapy treatments and live with better quality of life than in the desert of Las Vegas alone.

The place was decorated poorly but had wonderful hardwood floors. The real estate agent asked Steven "do you like it?" and when Steven said yes the agent said "good, because if you don't buy this unit, I will!"
