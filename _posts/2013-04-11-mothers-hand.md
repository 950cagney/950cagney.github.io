As a child, I held your hand

You helped to teach me valuable lessons and guided me through life

As an adult, I held your hand

Side-by-side we would laugh together and simply just enjoyed life.

On your final day, I held your hand

Reflecting on everything you meant to me and not wanting to let go of that loving hand, even after your last moment of life.

Every second of every day I miss you so very much. But in my heart, I know you will always be holding my hand as my guardian angel forever with me in life.

Besos Grande Mami, Adri (tu prencesita para siempre)
