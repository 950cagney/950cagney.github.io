During the Summer of 1987 (approximately), Cristina and her family planned a three-week European vacation through Spain, southern France, and Italy. When she requested time off from her supervisors at San Gabriel Medical Center, they denied her request (even though she was willing to take unpaid leave). 

In typical fashion -- and to "call their bluff" -- Cristina said "okay then I quit" right on the spot.

While her coworkers at the hospital would miss her greatly, the family had a fantastic European vacation and the memories that she so cherished. She made the right decision: **family over employment.**

Her good friend, coworker, and tenant Margo also signed a card with a funny _"If you see anything I want, you can bring **him** home for me"_
