Most of you know that for the last few years of Cristina's life, she was fortunate to have a very loving and loyal companion living with her: a ten-pound Italian Greyhound named "Giorgio".

Many have also asked what was to become of Giorgio now that Cristina is no longer with us.

Rest assured, we have found a good home for him. The daughter of Cristina's next door neighbor has a good friend who was looking for a small companion dog to keep her mother company. Although they did not know it at the time, they were the perfect new family for Giorgio. The mother has some health problems herself and needed a little loving creature that could give her the same comfort that Giorgio gave Cristina.

Giorgio met his new family February 8th and felt at home right away. He now resides in Redondo Beach and has a big backyard where he can run and relax in the warm sunlight and occasionally enjoys a dip in the pool.
