Cristina and I shared so many happy times together. We enjoyed our outings which she called a ["passeggiata"](https://www.myitaliandiaries.com/italian-passeggiata-what-exactly-is-that/) -- I don't know if I spelled that right -- but we had fun.

Cristina taught me "to stop and smell the roses." If the sun was shining, we'd be out -- either watching the sunset on the beach or having a leisurely drive.

On one occasion we got stopped by a police officer for a wrong turn. She said, "Don't tell my son!"

I loved your Mom.

**She was the most courageous woman I've ever known** and I will miss her.

Love, Gloria
