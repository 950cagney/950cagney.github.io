Cristina was fooled into thinking she would have a small subdued birthday celebration for her milestone 65th, accompanied by her sister Teresa (Petty). Instead, she walked into her favorite restaurant Nick's Pizza and was surprised with a dozen of her dear friends, a long celebration table, and gigantic balloons. 

The entire restaurant broke into a chorus of "Happy Birthday" and for a few minutes, Cristina's walker disappeared and she was filled with the happy spirit of those that loved her.
