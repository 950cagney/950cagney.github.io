Here's a beautiful photo of you on your 33rd birthday in 1976. 

It's hard to tell in this photo because you're cleverly leaning over, but you are hiding a 4-month pregnancy belly with Steven inside. I wouldn't arrive until five months later in October. 

I remember those golden curtains and the wicker chair from my early childhood memories. To the right is the arm of "Yaya", your mother-in-law that stayed with us until she passed away.

Steven still has the yellow clown cookie jar at his house.
