Mothers never really die

They just keep house up in the sky

They polish the sun by day

And light the stars at night

They keep the moonbeams silvery bright

And in their heavenly home above

They wait to welcome those they love

--[Helen Steiner Rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Steiner_Rice) (1900-1981), champion for women's rights
