Cristina, I first met you in June of 1999 when you told Adrienne that before she could go out with me that you must meet me. At first, of course I thought you were a little over protective, but now I know why I was about to start a relationship with your Princesscita.

I immediately found you to be a wonderful person and enjoyed our first meeting. I eventually found out from Adrienne that you thought I looked like Ricky Martin so of course my ego was stroked.

After time passed and getting to know you I knew that we would always get along. I was fortunate enough also to meet your mother Livia and saw that the apple did not fall far from the apple tree. You both were amazing women and I am so glad that I was able to meet Livia and eventually have you as my wonderful mother in law.

There were many conversations we would have about current events I would tell you some jokes and of course we would talk about Adrienne. You would always tell me to please take care of your Princesscita and I would reply with "always".

I have now been with your daughter for going on 14 years and I promised you that I would always take care of her and you have my word as your daughter has my heart. Thank you for being such a kind and wonderful person, you were always there for us and I truly want to say thank you. I will miss you and our conversations but one day we will reunite in heaven and be able to have our conversations once again.
