To celebrate a belated birthday for Cristina's son Steven, the two of them went out for breakfast at Wilma's Patio on Balboa Island in Newport Beach. Cristina's cheeks are rosy from the Decadron medication they gave her the day before along with her chemotherapy. Steven and Cristina enjoyed many breakfasts together and loved the quaint nature of Wilma's semi-exposed interior atrium seating.

Having just returned from a business trip to Barcelona, Steven was in the process of showing his mother some photos after breakfast when a sudden rain cloud dumped a brief but intense amount of rain on the plastic roof above the atrium. Cristina and son lingered longer than they intended, had another cup of coffee, and waited out the sudden shower.
