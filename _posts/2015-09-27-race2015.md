For the third year in a row, I participated in the Komen Race for the Cure 5 kilometer run/walk in Newport Beach. I was never much for fundraising but I really enjoy that the route of this event is a big circle around Fashion Island, where mom would always love to people-watch and window-shop. It's also very invigorating to see the Cancer survivors that walk alongside me (and sweat considerably less)!

As you can see, my fitness tracker was quite surprised to note a sedentary guy like myself racked up over 21,000 steps today 🏃 😰
