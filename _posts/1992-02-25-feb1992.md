As Adri was packing boxes, she found this handwritten letter from Kimberly before going away to college. It was written on extremely thin tissue paper, the type that was used back then to save on international postage. How crazy to imagine that this would just be a couple of emails today, or a five minute FaceTime or Skype conversation!
