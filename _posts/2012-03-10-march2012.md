You don't always need a special occasion to enjoy good food. One particular Saturday evening, Cristina and her son Steven decided to head over to Nick's Pizza and enjoy the nighttime "people-watching" (they almost always had lunch at Nick's and not dinner).

While waiting to be seated (her normally "reserved" table was occupied) they spotted a case of wine called "Santa Cristina" and in retrospect, it is such a fitting title for such a caring soul.

When finally seated, you could tell by the look of happiness and the size of the meal that Cristina was in high spirits and had an appetite!
