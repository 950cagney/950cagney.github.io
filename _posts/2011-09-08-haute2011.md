One day in September after a chemo treatment at Dr Barth's, Cristina was feeling a bit hungry. Her son Steven suggested stopping off at a quaint breakfast place called "Haute Cakes" near her condo.

As you can see, she had a great appetite despite the chemotherapy.

Steven would go back on the three month anniversary of Cristina's passing (April 26, 2013) to eat there again to remember Cristina. He enjoyed the fond memory and some delicious Orange-Ricotta pancakes with a (small?) side order of the "American Scramble".

And on what would have been [her 70th birthday](/memorial/haute2013), Michelle and Paola joined Steven at Haute Cakes.
