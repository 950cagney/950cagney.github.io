The day after Cristina left us (January 27), her sister Petty and her niece Paola joined Steven at Wilma's Patio for breakfast; they believed it was what Cristina would want them to do. Even though it was a spectacularly sunny and clear day, while the three of them were eating, a freak and sudden downpour rattled against the atrium's plastic roof. Cristina was joining us for breakfast, just like the [previous October](/memorial/wilmas-patio)!
