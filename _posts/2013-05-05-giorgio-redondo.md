As reported previously, Cristina's loving and loyal Italian Greyhound "Giorgio" was adopted by a caring family in Redondo Beach who renamed him "George". 

This weekend, the family took off to Palm Springs for a reunion and "George" came along for the ride!

The family reports that he has grown quite a bit in size, gets walked to the beach twice a day, learned to use a doggy door, and sleeps on a king size bed. They're doing their best to spoil "Prince George" (as they sometimes call him).
