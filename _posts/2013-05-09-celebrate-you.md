Cristina, I can't be there tonight to celebrate your 70th birthday with your family and friends, but I am celebrating you!

You have always been an inspiration to me. From childhood to adulthood, I would love to hear what you had to say about any topic. There aren't many people in the world who are so honest and forthcoming about their thoughts and feelings. Your fiery spirit was infectious. When I was diagnosed with cancer in 2010, you gave me courage to fight for my life and to face my fears.

I want you to know how much I love you and how much you have touched my life and will continue to.

I celebrate you, Cristina!

Love,
Melissa Lopez

p.s. We had such a great time [almost exactly a year ago at Mimi's Cafe](/memorial/mimis-cafe). As you can see from all our faces, it was always so wonderful to spend time together!
