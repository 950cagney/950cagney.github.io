The last trip that Cristina took before being diagnosed with the [return of her Cancer](/memorial/cancer2004) was a trip to Argentina in late 2003. Here is a scan of a blurry film photo (remember the days before digital?) of Cristina meeting some of her sister's horses in Buenos Aires, at an estancia called "Benquerencia".
