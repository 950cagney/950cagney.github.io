In 1971, the [United States Postal Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service) was inaugurated as a fully independent agency of the U.S. government. Starting with Benjamin Franklin before the country was formed up until 1971, the Post Office Department was an integral part of the federal government. 

Cristina went to the local post office in San Gabriel, California (where she lived at the time) to receive an inaugural independent USPS postmark as a collector's item.
