Dear Cristina:

You can't imagine the joy that the Kumquat plant gives me.

Every time I'm on the balcony the plant reminisces of your company. I remember when I gave you [its first crop by last Christmas](/memorial/bellaterra). 

Sometimes I can’t believe that being the 4th month of the year that plant is still full of fruit. I eat one of them every time I'm outside.

Thank you for giving me this living memory.

I love you and I feel that you’re watching us from heaven.

--Ana
