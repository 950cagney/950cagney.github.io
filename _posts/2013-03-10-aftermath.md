Here is an unfiltered look at the "aftermath" of Cristina's departure. Steven went through the condo and set aside things to keep, things to donate, and things to potentially offer at a garage sale. It was a grim and somewhat depressing expereince over several days (weeks) but Steven was helped greatly with the support of his friends that assisted with moving and selling furniture items.

Mom's split hostpital style bed (inherited from her mother Livia) that she used to raise and lower the angle to her comfort now looked very sad. Making the bed and documenting things during the depressing moments is a form of therapy.

The guest bedroom still had Nona Livia's furniture from Las Vegas, which was later sold at a garage sale. I still remember that crystal "princess" style telephone that she loved showing off in her living room:

With some brown furniture covers, the (very 80s) floral print sofa and loveseats survived in the newly remodeled condo another 12 years until they were donated in September 2025 to make way for a new sofa:
