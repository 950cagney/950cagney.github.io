After living with a ktichen that was stuck in the 80s for four years, Cristina decided to "treat herself" to a beautiful kitchen remodel with granite countertops and new black stove for all her wonderful cooking.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">

</div>

Here's a taste of what it looked like before the remodel. Note that the pantry didn't even have doors on it!
