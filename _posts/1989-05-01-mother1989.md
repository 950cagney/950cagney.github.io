> _I think my mother should be mother of the year because she helps me remember things and helps me with projects, and when I'm sick she helps me feel better. She takes me to dance on time. She pays for me going to dance and school. She supports the school, and brings flowers and helps my teacher. She thinks of me while I'm gone. That's Why My Mom Is Special!_
