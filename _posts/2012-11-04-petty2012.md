Cristina's sister Petty was so generous with her time -- flying in from Argentina for the entire month of May to celebrate Cristina's birthday and Mother's Day and then returning again (usually) in October. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy disrupted her plans and flooded Manhattan where Petty was staying with her daughter Michelle.

Undeterred, Petty checked back with the airlines every day and was on the very first Los Angeles-bound flight after the FAA cleared flights to depart JFK airport. Although brief, Cristina loved spending time with her sister. They were as close as any two sisters you could ever imagine -- and even that doesn't come close to explain their special bond.

Fun side note: Petty had never tried Thai food and so on the last night of her abbreviated trip, Petty and Steven enjoyed a Thai feast while Cristina looked on cautiously and enjoyed her oatmeal rather than the adventurous exotic items.
