Just like Cristina would have wanted, tonight we gathered with her friends and family to celebrate her [70th birthday](/memorial/may9) at her favorite ristorante, Nick's Pizza.

The guest of honor sat just off to the side, on a beautiful canvas photo and easel provided by Ana. We swapped stories and remembered fondly the spirit of life that exemplified Cristina. We ate pizza and sampled a delicious tiramisu provided by the restaurant owner (along with a beautiful dozen coral colored roses). We occupied fully half of the dining room and stayed until they turned off the lights.

What a great way to celebrate such a milestone in Cristina's life, albeit cut just short of the actual date. Thank you to the family and friends that spent the evening with us and to those that were celebrating _in absentia_ from great distances.
