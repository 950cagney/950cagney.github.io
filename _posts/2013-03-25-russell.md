We will never forget her radiant smile.

When we saw her in the hallway or the elevator, she would always ask how my little son Oliver was doing. She knew him from birth to about 1.5 years old and each time she smiled at him, he would smile back at her.

She had a special warmth and presence that even a small child could connect to. My fondest memory of Cristina is that she would always notice how much Oliver had grown and said that one day he will be tall like his daddy and her son Steven. I hope she is right!

We will truly miss her.

--Love, The Russell Family
