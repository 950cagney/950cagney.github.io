Cristina loved going to shopping malls -- but not for the shopping. 

She absolutely loved the people watching and witnessing the "soap opera of everyday life" as she put it. 

Her very good friends Ana and Walter O'Brien accompanied her this sunny beautiful day to the Bella Terra shopping center in Huntington Beach.

Months earlier, Cristina had gifted a kumquat tree to Ana. In the photo here, they returned the gift with the first fruit from the tree.
