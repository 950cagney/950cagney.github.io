Giorgio is doing great and now lives in the Naples area of Long Beach. He has his own balcony to watch the dogs and people go by. He also stays with my parents if I'm busy or traveling. He is extremely spoiled and has a toy basket filled with bones and only eats certain treats and his specialized diet. Not a huge fan of dog parks or the dog beaches but he loves our daily walks down Naples Plaza and has a large number of dog pals that live near by. He's well socialized and well fed. Has his own potty with artificial grass on the balcony with a doggie door. He eats like a football player so just trying to keep his weight down and exercise him a lot. He has several beds but sleeps in a Queen size bed under a down comforter most nights. My dad is doing well, thanks for asking. Parkinson's is tricky but he has up days and down days and it's just something we deal with as best we can.

If you're ever in the area, \[come over\] and his balcony is on the bottom right corner of the building. Just call out his name and he usually comes running out to the balcony (several of his fans already do this).
