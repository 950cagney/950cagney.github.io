Three years ago today...
Your courageous presence and light faded
But I still see you in my dreams full with life

Three years ago today…
Your guiding voice was silenced
But I still hear your advice ringing in my ears

Three years ago today…
We lost your loving embrace
But I still feel your caring arms around me

I miss you tremendously every day but I know you are always with us all

Para Mami ~ Te quiero mucho ~ Con amor, tu princesita
