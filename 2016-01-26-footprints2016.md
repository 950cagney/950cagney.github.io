I feel very lucky to have known Cristina. For her, this poem by Maynard rings true -- she left footprints on the souls of everyone who knew her:

You cast the shadows out
bringing sunshine into view
i see the footprints in my soul
surely placed by you

Waking me from my slumber
you fill me with such joy
you bring the sunshine in my life
and my darkness you destroy

With footprints on my soul
i am a happy man
this time that i see go by
we will meet again

Your name is written down
deep within my heart
these feelings that i have for you
never will depart

The time between will grow
i miss you so much
i need to have another taste
i need another touch
